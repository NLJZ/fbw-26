            Felix Kubin (born Felix Knoth; 1969 in Hamburg, West Germany) is an
            electronic musician. He has been involved with music since he was 8
            years old, when he studied piano, organ and glockenspiel. His
            youthful experiments took off in 1980 when he got a Korg MS-20
            synthesizer. His early works have been released under the title The
            Tetchy Teenage Tapes of Felix Kubin. During this time he also played
            in a punk band Die Egozentrischen 2. In 1987 Felix Kubin co-founded
            an experimental noise group Klangkrieg with Tim Buhre. His first
            solo album Filmmusik was released in 1998 by Gagarin Records,
            Kubin's own label founded in the same year through which he has gone
            on to release a series of albums including the critically acclaimed
            Matki Wandalki in 2004.

            Kubin regularly collaborates on theatrical and animation
            productions, writes radio plays and is a self-described dadaist. His
            musical influences include contemporary classics such as Karlheinz
            Stockhausen and Gy√∂rgy Ligeti, as well as groups such as Kraftwerk
            and DAF.
