//Declare a variable named “euroCities” and assign an array to the variable e.g. [“Paris”, “London”, “Valletta”, “Prague”, “Rome”].
const euroCities = ["Paris", "London", "Valletta", "Prague", "Rome"];
console.log(euroCities);

//Declare another variable and assign the second item of the array as a value.
let secondCity = euroCities[1];
console.log(secondCity);

//Change the first item in the array to “Berlin”.
euroCities[0] = "Berlin";
console.log(euroCities);

//Print the length of the array “euroCities”.
console.log(euroCities.length);

//Remove the last item of the array “euroCities”.
euroCities.pop();
console.log(euroCities);
//Use an array method to add “Budapest” to the euroCities array.
euroCities.push("Budapest");
console.log(euroCities);
//Create another variable named asianCities and assign an array of at least 5 cities to the variable.
//Use an array method to select items 2-4 from the array of asianCities and store this in another variable.

//sumOfNumbers. Create a program that adds up the numbers in an array (of at least 3 numbers).
//Bonus: Print to screen both the sum and the product of these numbers.
//Hello Friend Create an array filled with your friends’ and family’s names. Loop over the array and greet each friend e.g. Hello Maria! Hello Mike! etc.
//Bonus: Print the indexes of each item in the array. Expected output example: Mike is at index 1 of my friends array.
//City Names. Create an array of city names. Loop through the array and add the city names to a string.
//Example of expected output: “Berlin, Paris, Prague, Rome”.

//Odds and Evens. Create a program that changes a given array by adding 1 to each odd integer and subtracting 1 from each even integer. Examples:[3, 5, 2, 4] ➞ expected output: [4, 6, 1, 3]
//[6, 9, 10, 20] ➞ expected output: [5, 10, 9, 19]
//Capitalize. Create a program that capitalises the first letter of each element in an array of names. Examples:
//[“matt”, “sara”, “lara”] ➞ [“Matt”, “Sara”, “Lara”]
//[“samuel”, “MARIA”, “luke”, “mary”] ➞ [“Samuel”, “Maria”, “Luke”, “Mary”]
//[“cynthia”, “karen”, “jaNe”, “carrie”] ➞ [“Cynthia”, “Karen”, “Jane”, “Carrie”]
